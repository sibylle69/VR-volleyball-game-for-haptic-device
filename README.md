# VR-volleyball-game-for-haptic-device
VR volleyball game prototype that demonstrates a wearable haptic device developed by Valkyrie Industries, a start-up that is developing a universal technology of touch for virtual simulations using electro-stimulation. The game is split in three scenes: 
- a bluetooth set-up scene to connect the VR headset with the haptic device
- a calibration scene to enable personalized virtual experiences
- a game scene to play volleyball with haptic feedback

This prototype was made as part of an internship at Valkyries Industries (https://www.valkyrieindustries.co.uk/). Some parts of the project are therefore kept internally, like the programs that drive the haptic device.
